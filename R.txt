R is a statistical and graphical programming language that has specialized in manipulating,
analyzing and visualizing data, and is currently considered one of the best tools for
this purpose.

****Variables****
They are created by the programmer for the purpose of saving information. Information
entered into a variable will be available for use as long as the variable exists. The variables
will have a specific type, according to the type of data that was saved or according to the
programmer's instructions.

****Functions****
They are a set of predefined instructions that perform one or more tasks. There are many
functions ready for use, saved in packages designed to facilitate the creation of scripts. The more
functions the programmer knows, the easier it will be to write his scripts. It is also possible to create
functions in the script itself, passing all the instructions that should occur when the function is used.

****Operators****
With operators we perform mathematical operations, such as addition, division, multiplication, etc.,
and comparisons such as equal, different, greater and lesser. We can also use the logical operators AND, OR, and
negation to simplify our codes.

****Data types****
Numeric (mathematical operations), characters (operations with letters, words, phrases, etc.),
factors (categories) and logical (true or false). These are the basic data types that exist in the R language.

****Data structure****
Vectors, which are a sequence of data of the same type. Lists, which are vectors with different
data types. Arrays, which have two dimensions and one data type. Data frames, which are more complex structures,
similar to Excel spreadsheets and with different types of data.

****Conditionals****
If, For and While. In the If conditional, we say that if something is true, an action must be performed,
if it is not, another will be (or none). In the For loop, one or more instructions will be executed a certain number of
times. In the While loop, instructions will be carried out as long as a condition is met.
